# Gauss
System to solve systems of linear equations with any number of equations by the method of GaussSeidel.

## How does GaussSeidel method works?

- See if our equation is possible to resolve.
- Change array ord until there is no zeros in the main diagonal.
- Turn the 1Â° element of the first line in **1**, dividing all the numbers for the first one.
